### This is all pretty unstable right now and I wouldn't recommend using it as a stable build but it will hopefully have a nice feature set eventually


This will only work on a Linux (or MacOS) system due to snowboys dependencies, there are some external libraries needed as well. Eventually the dockerfile should include everything but be warned there are dependecy issues.

To use the docker build it can be gotten from dockerhub at [jordanryoungberg/computer](https://hub.docker.com/r/jordanryoungberg/computer). When using be sure to include a .env file.

###### this will be cohesive eventually I'm sorry
